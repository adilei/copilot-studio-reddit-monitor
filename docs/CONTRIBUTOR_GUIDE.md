# Contributor Workflow Guide

A step-by-step guide for contributors working with the Social Monitor.

## Step 1: Add Your Reddit Handle

Before you can respond to posts, make sure your Reddit handle is linked to your profile.

1. Sign in with your Microsoft account
2. Go to **Contributors** and find your name
3. If your Reddit handle isn't shown, ask an admin to add it

Your Reddit handle allows the system to automatically detect when you reply on Reddit.

## Step 2: Check the Dashboard

Start your workflow by looking at the dashboard for posts that need attention.

**Priority items to check:**

| What to Look For | Why |
|------------------|-----|
| **Waiting for Pickup** | Posts no one has claimed yet - these need someone to pick them up |
| **Boiling Posts** | Urgent posts from frustrated users - handle these first |

If there are boiling posts, click through to see details and prioritize responding to them.

## Step 3: Checkout a Post

When you're going to respond to a post, **checkout first** to let the team know you're handling it.

1. Go to **Posts** and find a post to handle
2. Click the post to open the detail view
3. Click **Checkout to handle**

This prevents duplicate responses - teammates will see the post is being worked on.

**Tip:** Filter by **Sentiment: Negative** to find frustrated users who need help most.

## Step 4: Mark as Resolved

After handling a post, mark it as resolved so it's cleared from the queue.

Click **Mark as Done** when:

- **You responded** on Reddit
- **There's already a good response** from another community member (doesn't have to be from Microsoft)
- **No action needed** - the question was already answered or is outdated

This keeps the "Waiting for Pickup" count accurate and helps the team focus on posts that still need attention.

## Quick Reference

| Action | When |
|--------|------|
| **Checkout** | Before you start working on a post |
| **Mark as Done** | After responding, or if there's already a good answer |
| **Release** | If you checked out but can't handle it |
| **Reopen** | If a resolved post needs follow-up |
